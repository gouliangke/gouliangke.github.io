  Novartis 

  Senior Expert Data Science I/Principal Biostatistician

    * Early Phase Hematology Clinical Trial
	
      Responsible for statistical tasks covering data analyses, dosage escalation and potentially dosage expansion. Represent biostatistics on cross-functional international teams for the assigned trial and collaborate with other line functions.

    * Digital Health Clinical Trial
    
      Perform exploratory analyses for innovative clinical digital endpoints with a variety of data architectures. Formulate integrated analytical approach to mine data sources, employ statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to discover actionable insights.

    * Deep learning and machine learning
    
      Build predictive models using various machine learning methods to predict the outcome. Use deep learning algorithms to analyze digital data (e.g. Electroencephalography data)

    * Proteomics and GenomicsData Mining
    
      Integrate SomaScan data and Genomics data from multiple clinical trials to understand the underlying mechanisms of diseases and to identify novel drug targets. Served as the proteomics committee to conduct lecture series on Proteomics and SomaScan data analyses.
      
    * Pre-clinical Statistical Support
    
      Perform sample size calculation and provide statistical support for pre-clinical biologist and researchers. Developed the statistical justification and method part for the European Animal License renew. Contribute to the Non-clinical Statistics best working practice.

    * Statistical Consulting
    
      Provide consulting support for projects requiring hands-on expertise in novel quantitative approaches, including incorporating evidence from sources of big data (biomarkers, digital technology and real world evidence).

    * Smart Visualization
    
      Design and develop the analysis pipelines, provide data-driven hypotheses and deliver smart visualization platforms (eg. RShiny app) to offer exploratory analyses support for researchers.
