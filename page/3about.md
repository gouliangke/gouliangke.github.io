## About me

### Sweet foodie


### A girl loves travel


### Animal lover

I love animals since I was a child. Now I have a guinea pig (planning to find a friend for my little pig). Ever evening I will spend time playing with my little guinea pig Foo-foo. Foo-foo is such a gentle cute and clever guinea pig. I have taught Foo-foo to do different tricks and Foo-foo learned all task super fast. During the interaction with Foo-foo, I become more patient and optimistic.
