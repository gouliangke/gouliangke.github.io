## About me

### Foodie
I was brought up in Chengdu, a city known as the "Country of Heaven", in Sichuan Western China. This city is full of amazing Sichuanese food, and one of the most traditional one is hot pot. I eat hot pot often and there are hot pot restaurants widely-distributed throughout the city. Besides, food stalls in Chengdu offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snakes, and one of my favorite is spicy beef jerky. As a child growing in the environment surrounded by all delicious food, enjoying appetizing food become a typical part of my life. I really appreciate that I studied in Los Angeles, because it has a large variety of food all over the world. During the few years I lived in western LA, I have explored a large number of different restaurants in Westwood, Sawtelle Japanese Village, Korean Town, China town, San Gabriel and Monterey Park. Besides the Asian and American food, I gradually being addicted to Mexican food recently. Now I go out and try good food every week, hope in the future I can continue my foodie adventure where ever I go for work. 


### Love to Travel 

Getting away from home gives me the opportunity to reflect on my life and appreciate the beauty of nature. Also travelling usually recharge me with energy when I was tired of work. I really love the national parks in the US, and have explored some of them. Every national park gives me an impressive unique experience. I find it super exciting to explore the local culture, the different natural scenery and the local animals in different parks.

### Animal lover

I love animals since I was a child. Now I have two guinea pigs. Ever evening I will spend time playing with my little guinea pig Feifei and Huihui. They are both gentle, cute and clever guinea pigs. I have taught Feifei to do different tricks and he learned all task super fast. During the interaction with Feifei, I become more patient and optimistic.
