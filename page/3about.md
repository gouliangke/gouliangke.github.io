## About me

### Foodie

I was brought up in Chengdu, a city known as the "Country of Heaven", in Sichuan Western China. This city is full of amazing Sichuanese food, and one of the most traditional one is hot pot. I eat hot pot often and there are hot pot restaurants widely-distributed throughout the city. Besides, food stalls in Chengdu offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snakes, and one of my favorite is spicy beef jerky. As a child growing in the environment surrounded by all delicious food, enjoying appetizing food become a typical part of my life. I really appreciate that I studied in Los Angeles, because it has a large variety of food all over the world. During the few years I lived in western LA, I have explored a large number of different restaurants in Westwood, Sawtelle Japanese Village, Korean Town, China town, San Gabriel and Monterey Park. Besides the Asian and American food, I gradually being addicted to Mexican food recently. Now I go out and try good food every week, hope in the future I can continue my foodie adventure where ever I go for work. 


### Travel Lover

Getting away from home gives me the opportunity to reflect on my life and appreciate the beauty of nature. Also travelling usually recharge me with energy when I was tired of work. I really love the national parks in the US, and have explored some of them. Every national park gives me an impressive unique experience. I find it super exciting to explore the local culture, the different natural scenery and the local animals in different parks.

### Animal Person

I love animals since I was a child. I have a purebred German Shepherd FeiFei since he was a baby. He is smart, loyal, friendly and believes everything is pawsible. He knows a large amound of tricks and enjoys fetching the balls with my husband and me. The first pictures show how FeiFei transforms into a handsome big boy (1 yr) from a puppy (8 weeks) 

In the past I also had three guinea pigs. I taught my guinea pigs to do different tricks and they learned the tasks fast. During the interaction with my furry friends, I become more patient and optimistic.
