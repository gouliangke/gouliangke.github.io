- name: Quantitative Trait Mapping for Mutation Rate 
  url: https://github.com/gouliangke/myblog/raw/master/photos/MR.png
  background: Mutations are the root source of genetic variation and underlie the process of evolution. Although the rates at which mutations occur vary considerably between species, little is known about differences within species, or the genetic and molecular basis of these differences. In this project, I leveraged the power of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to uncover natural genetic variants that underlie variation in mutation rate.
  description: In this project, I developed a high-throughput fluctuation assay and used it to quantify mutation rates in natural yeast isolates and in 1040 segregant progeny from a cross between BY, a lab strain, and RM, a wine strain. We observed that mutation rate varies among yeast strains and is highly heritable (H2=0.46). We performed linkage mapping in the segregants and identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying mutation rate variation in the cross. I fine-mapped two QTLs to the underlying causal genes, RAD5 and MKT1, that contribute to mutation rate variation. These genes also underlie sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents 4NQO and MMS, suggesting a connection between spontaneous mutation rate and mutagen sensitivity.

  background: The fundamental goal of genetics is to understand the link between genetic variation and trait variation across the entire range of biological phenomena, from genetic diseases to pathogen virulence. However, current methods for trait mapping often span many genes, and narrowing them to the specific underlying genes and genetic variants can be painstaking. Recently my lab has successfully fine-mapped manganese sensitivity to a single polymorphism in yeast by generating a mapping panel with targeted recombination events using CRISPR. I aim to apply this approach that my lab has successfully used to map traits in yeast to human cells. 
  description: I start with H9 human embryonic stem cell, given its diploid and pluripotent characteristic. I have generated a stable H9 cell line that contains a heterozygous selectable marker on chromosome 16 close to the telomere. By introducing double strand breaks at designed sites along chromosome 16 using CRISPR-cas9, followed by selection for cells undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH), I will be able to generate a mapping panel of cells with different sizes carrying homozygous recombinant genomes to the telomere. Once developed, this mapping panel will allow us to map loci that control gene expression and other traits in human cells with high resolution without limitations by recombination rates and the length of linkage blocks. By differentiating the H9 stem cells into different cell lines, this mapping panel will enable fine mapping with a wide variety of cell type specific traits, shredding light on the genetic effect in different cells. 
  
- name: Base Editor
  url: https://github.com/gouliangke/myblog/raw/master/photos/BE.png
  background: The CRISPR base editors are programmable DNA editing systems that induce single-nucleotide changes in the DNA using a fusion protein containing a catalytically defective Cas9, a cytidine or adenine deaminase, and an inhibitor of base excision repair. This genome editing approach has the advantage that it does not require generation of double-stranded DNA breaks or a donor DNA template. Adenine and cytidine deaminases convert their target nucleotides to other DNA bases, enabling versatile DNA editing. Base editors with natural or engineered Cas9 variants can target genomes at different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sites, which significantly expand the number of sites that can be targeted by base editing. However, a systematic analysis of the performance of different base editors has not been conducted. 
  description: Here I evaluated the editing efficiency of ten different base editors in the model organism Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Three different guide RNAs (gRNAs) Ire designed for each base editor to target gene CAN1. Each pair of gRNA and base editor was transformed into millions of yeast. The conversion of the original nucleotide will introduce premature stop codons or create non-synonymous mutations at the targeted region. Successful editing will produce loss of function in gene CAN1, making yeast resistant to the arginine analog canavanine. A general editing efficiency was estimated from the number of canavanine resistant colonies after inducing the editing system. A quantitative estimate of the editing efficiency was measured by sequencing all the targeted regions. I observed that the editing efficiency was highly dependent on the gRNAs. The third generation base editor (BE3) had the highest editing efficiencies (above 50%) among all tested base editors, while the fourth generation base editor (BE4) had loIr efficiencies (around 20%). The base editors VQR, EQR, VRER (with the NGAN, NGAG, NGCG PAM respectively) had a general efficiency around 8%, but for some sites, the VQR had an efficiency of up to 25%. The ABE base editor that can convert A to G had similar or slightly loIr efficiencies than BE3. One gRNA that worked efficiently for BE3 shoId much loIr efficiency when used for ABE, indicating different gRNA preferences for the adenine deaminase. Base editor with the NNGRRT and NNNRRT PAM sites (base editors SA and SAKKH) had a relatively low efficiency (around 8%) for the tested sites. Our study suggests that CRISPR/Cas9-guided base editing is a poIrful alternative approach to generate variants in yeast, especially when there are available enrichment approaches for the expected phenotypes.
