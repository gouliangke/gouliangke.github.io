first_paragraph: Hi, welcome to my homepage! I am Connie, a 5th year Ph.D. student in Human Genetics Department at UCLA. I am in the lab of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kruglyak" target="_blank"> professor Leonid Kruglyak</a>, the chair of Human Genetics department. I am also a master student in the Statistics Department working with  <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/" target="_blank">professor Yinglian Wu</a>. 
second_paragraph: My PhD research mainly focused on understanding how natural variants affect the phenotypic variation, or how changes in the DNA level affect the traits of individuals. One of my projects, which was recently published on <a href="http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2018/11/30/genetics.118.301609" target="_blank"> Genetics</a>, tried to uncover the genetic basis of spontaneous mutation rate in Yeast. I have developed a high-throughput fluctuation assay to measure spontaneous mutation rate in large scale for the first time. I have performed genetic linkage analysis to 1040 segregants from a cross between two diverse yeast strains and have mapped out four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to the mutation rate variation these strains. I further fine-mapped the largest two QTLs to causal genes and variants. During the genetic mapping for mutation rate, linear and nonlinear statistical methods were applied. In addition to genetic fine mapping, I dissected the effect of natural variants to the base pair resolution using the popular genetic engineering tool CRISPR-Cas9 and the CRISPR base editor in yeast and human cell lines. I built different machine learning models and a deep learning model to predict the editing efficiency and explored the feature importance to interpret the model. I am sophisticated with a large number of machine learning methods (including but not limited to logistic regression, SVM, random forest, adaboost, Convolutional Neural Network) and can flexibly apply them to biological data analysis.
