first_paragraph: I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Human Genetics working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kruglyak" target="_blank"> professor Leonid Kruglyak</a>, the chair of Human Genetics department, at UCLA. I did the bi-diploma artigulated program, therefore I am also a master student in the Statistics department working with  <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/" target="_blank">professor Yinglian Wu</a>. I led several research projects during my PhD. The first one, which has been accepted and will be
 published on <a href="http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2018/11/30/genetics.118.301609" target="_blank"> Genetics</a>, focused on understanding the genetic basis of spontaneous mutation rate in Yeast. I performed quantitative trait mapping (QTL mapping) in 1040 natural yeast isolates from a cross between two natural yeast strains, BY and RM. I identified four QTLs that contribute to mutation rate variation.  
 I also had three other projects that aims to develop CRISPR-cas9 based high-throughput genetic engineering approaches to dissect the effect of natural variants in both yeast and human stem cell lines. The variant engineering approaches will enable us to understand the effect of different natural variants better, and will help us understand the molecular mechanisms behind different phenotypes.
second_paragraph: My Statistics master thesis project is building a prediction model to predict the editing efficiency of Cas9 Base editors using deep-learning based convolutional neural network. The model can also be modified to predict the edting efficiency of Cas9 repaire template system. The model benefits the gRNA design for my CRISPR-cas9 projects.
