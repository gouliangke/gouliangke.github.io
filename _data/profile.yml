first_paragraph: I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Human Genetics working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kruglyak" target="_blank">Dr. Leonid Kruglyak</a> at UCLA. My Research focused on understanding the correlation between natural genetic variants and the trait. To address this relationship, I applied quantitative trait mapping (QTL mapping) to identify regions associated with certain phenotype, as well as using the genetic engineering approaches to dissect the effect of various genome polymorphisms. 
second_paragraph: I completed my B.S. in Sichuan University.
