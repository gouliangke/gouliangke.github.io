first_paragraph: I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Human Genetics working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kruglyak" target="_blank">Dr. Leonid Kruglyak</a> at UCLA. I am also a master student in Statistics working with  <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/" target="_blank">Dr. Yinglian Wu</a>. My PhD Research focused on understanding the correlation between natural genetic variants and the trait. To address this relationship, I applied quantitative trait mapping (QTL mapping) to identify regions associated with certain phenotype, as well as using the genetic engineering approaches to dissect the effect of various genome polymorphisms. My Statistics master project used a deep-larning framework based on a convolutional neural network to predict the activity of Cas9 Base editors.
second_paragraph: I completed my B.S. in Sichuan University.
