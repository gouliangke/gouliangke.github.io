first_paragraph: Hi, welcome to my homepage! I am Connie and I am currently a senior data scientist at Novartis. I have a diverse background in statistics, bioinformatics and biomedicine. I also have enriched working experiences in pre-clinical projects and both early & late phase clinical studies. 
second_paragraph: I specialize in deep learning, machine learning and multi-omics data analysis. As mentioned I have been working on several projects in both clinical and non-clinical fields, including performing the digital device data analysis for diagnostic purpose, supporting the Rshiny exploratory app for the Hidradenitis Suppurativa task force, providing statistical support for the early phase Hematology trial as trial statistician and support the biomarker analysis for the late phase clinical trials in the whole AMD/MDS disease area. I also performed exploratory analysis using the time-series EEG (electroencephalogram) data and the high-dimensional SOMAScan data in collaboration with experts in the Neuroscience and Cardiovascular disease areas. 
third_paragraph: Before joining Novartis, I studied Human Genetics and Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles. I studied Genomics with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kruglyak" target="_blank"> professor Leonid Kruglyak</a>, the chair of Human Genetics department. And I worked with <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/" target="_blank">professor Yinglian Wu</a> on the Statistics project.
fourth_paragraph: During my research, I built different machine learning and deep learning models to solve biological questions. I also performed linkage and association studies using genomic data to find out causal genes for disease related traits. I love travelling, trying out good food and cute animals. I have a one-year-old German Shepherd and I truly enjoy every walk with him.
